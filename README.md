## Role-Based Dashboards

### Admin Dashboard

- View and manage access requests
- Monitor product popularity and recent API usage
- Access key platform metrics such as:
  - Net Promoter Score (NPS)
  - API call volume
  - User statistics
- Review user-submitted ratings and feedback

### User Dashboard

- Browse available synthetic data products
- Request access to datasets
- Track access request status (e.g., pending, approved)
- View recent API usage

## Platform Metrics

The platform simulates various usage and engagement statistics, including:

- Total users
- Active users (last 7 days)
- API usage volume
- Access request counts and status breakdown
- User feedback volume and sentiment
- Simulated NPS (Net Promoter Score)

## Mock Datasets

The platform hosts several synthetic datasets, such as:

- Consumer Behavior trends
- Financial Market indicators
- Weather Data across regions

Note: Dataset downloads are only enabled post approval of access requests.

## API Usage Tracking

All data product interactions are monitored, allowing admins to view API call trends and usage patterns.

## Feedback & Rating System

Users can rate datasets based on:

- Quality
- Completeness
- Usability
- Overall satisfaction

![Dataset Rating](https://github.com/nbahador/Data_Product_Platform_Simulation/blob/main/img/dataset_rating.png)

Users can submit:

- Product-specific feedback
- General platform feedback
- Question/bug report/help request

All feedback is visible in the admin dashboard for continuous platform improvement.

## Access Control

Users must request access to datasets, which is reviewed and approved by platform administrators. Access status is tracked and displayed in the user dashboard.
